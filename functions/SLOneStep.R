### Commentary: 
# performs one step of the super learner algorithm (that is for the indicated i'th sample)

# inputs:

# samples_list: list; list of samples, as outputted by "LoobSample.R". See corresponding file.
# B: integer; the sample to consider. i.e the B'th subsample from the samples_list input will be considered.
# times: vector; time points to predict for.
# event_library: string vector; the event libraries to consider for the survSuperLearner function. 
# See survSuperLearner:::survlistWrappers() for available  default wrappers.
# cens_library: string vector; the censoring libraries to consider for the survSuperLearner function. 
# See survSuperLearner:::survlistWrappers() for available  default wrappers.

# output: list of 3. contents:

# preds: named list of predictions. Each member of the list is a (i x times) matrix of predictions 
# with a corresponding name (i.e preds$survSL.coxph for a cox model) where the unit i,j of the matrix is the risk prediction for the
# i'th person in the subsample for the j'th time. The meta learner predictions are alwats named "sl".

# scores: list of length "times" (see inputs),  named accordingly (t1, t2, t3..) that contains the model name, time and corresponding Brier score
# for each library along with the meta learner. By default arranged from lowest to highest Brier scores.

# coefs: single named vector of length equal to length(event_library). Contains the alpha (weight) of each library for the meta learner prediction.
# the libraries with coefficients 0 are dropped from the algorithm. Does not vary across time.
